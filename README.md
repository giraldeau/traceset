# Set of traces for demo and testing purposes

Traces in this repository are automatically generated. The workloads are designed to trigger specific behavior of the system. They are recorded using LTTng kernel tracer and LTTng-UST.

These traces are useful for exploring traces without a full tracing environment. They can be used for unit test purpose.
